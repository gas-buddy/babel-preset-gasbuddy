# Babel 7.x presets for Node 8.x with GasBuddy twist

Based on [babel-preset-node6](https://github.com/Salakar/babel-preset-node6) and [babel-preset-es2017](https://github.com/bettiolo/babel-preset-es2017)

## Why

Because we want high performance node8-compatible code with transparent React support and small bundles... and so we can modify all our dependent project configuration in one place.
