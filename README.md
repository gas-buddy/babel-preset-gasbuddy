# Babel 6.x presets for Node 6.x with GasBuddy twist

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/gas-buddy/babel-preset-gasbuddy.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Based on [babel-preset-node6](https://github.com/Salakar/babel-preset-node6) and [babel-preset-es2017](https://github.com/bettiolo/babel-preset-es2017)

## Why

Because we want node6 with async/await and Object.entries, and to modify all our dependent project configuration by modifying this module.
